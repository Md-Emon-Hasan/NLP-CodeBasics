# NLP CodeBasics

This repository provides fundamental code examples and techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers essential concepts, tools, and methods such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and text classification. The project employs popular Python libraries like **spaCy**, **NLTK**, and **Gensim** to implement various NLP tasks.

Key Features:
- Tokenization with **spaCy**
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging** and **Named Entity Recognition** (NER)
- Text representation with **TF-IDF**, **Word Vectors**, and **Word2Vec**
- **Text Classification** using **spaCy** and **Gensim**
- Comparative studies: **spaCy vs NLTK**
- Advanced NLP techniques for feature extraction and preprocessing
